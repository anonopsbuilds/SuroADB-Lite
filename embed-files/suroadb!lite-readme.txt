SuroADB Lite
=============================================================
ABOUT

SuroADB Lite is a reworked user-intuitive version of it's predecessor, SuroADB.

SuroADB is a simple ADB command interface with various features for easy and
reliable adb command execution. It features auto-restore scripts, error handling,
an easy-to-read user interface, several settings, and more technical code that
slightly improves performance and experience.

The Lite version lacks added error handling features and does not have
auto-restoring capabilities, it also lacks global configurations.


ADB is not made by Kutsuro (Matt) and is present for the purpose of functionality
for SuroADB. The adb windows zip (platform-tools)  is not  modified and is
taken straight from the android developer sdk.

Note: Please do not re-release the raw SuroADB script and claim it as your own creation.
          If  you're  going to  modify  and/or  add  new  features,  please  provide credit to the
          original author (me). It is not required, but i'll really appreciate it. =D
