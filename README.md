ABOUT

SuroADB Lite is a reworked user-intuitive version of it's predecessor, SuroADB.

SuroADB is a simple ADB command interface with various features for easy and
reliable adb command execution. It features auto-restore scripts, error handling,
an easy-to-read user interface, several settings, and more technical code that
slightly improves performance and experience.

The Lite version lacks added error handling features and does not have
auto-restoring capabilities, it also lacks global configurations.
